use spectral clustering on the cleaned adjacency matrix
fix a performance measures
    substract outcome matrix from groundtruth matrix
        square it/count the number of 0's and 1's
    false positives and negatives
making cuts is inefficient O(2^n)
XcTA(e-Xc)
convex optimization (CVX)
gradient descent

to do:
- convert groundtruth to clique matrix
-
